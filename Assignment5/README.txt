Note: If you are viewing the "QueryMetrics.csv" file, please don't open it in IDE like PyCharm or any other as it does not support the format of comma separated output which is supported when opening it separately in Microsoft Excel(preferred).

1. A short note about other aspects of each search engine, excluding the relevance of the results. What did you like or dislike about the presentation of the results, other features on the page etc.

-> I liked the spotlight pages information that is highlighted in right pane and results that are listed in points above the URL (which many times answers the query without opening the URL).

I really dislike the fact that advertisements are always on the top and in the same blue color as the other URLs. The "Ad" written beneath is really not much help to clearly differentiate between the resultant URL which is not an advertisement unless you look out for it closely. According to me, they can try putting the advertisement URLs highlighted in a different color other than blue which will make it clearly distinctive.
Also, they can try to put ads in a different place other than the top. Bing, in fact, puts some of their ads not only on top but also on bottom :(

2. A one or two sentence answer to each of these questions: What was the most difficult part of this assignment? What was the easiest part?

-> The most difficult part of the assignment was to visit each URL in the unique pool of merged results of Google and Bing to mark it relevant or not. This was very time consuming to visit a total of 35 URLs for the combined three queries and then read the content to judge whether it is relevant or not. I understand now, why companies hire other people to do this work. They should pay them more to be honest (it is a pain).

The easiest part was coding as there was not much to be done except for computing the precision results along with other metrics and formatting them in an output file.

3. In doing this assignment, what did you learn about any of the engines that most surprised you?

-> When comparing results from both the search engines, I was surprised to see that not only some of the results were same (and many were same for different query), but also at some places the position of the same result was identical.

For example:
https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/home-remedies
The above URL returned by both the search engine (Google and Bing) was at first position for the query "common cold home remedies", and there were other examples too where the same result position was identical.

By making an educated guess, I can conclude that the various algorithms used to compute the top results in backend processing are mostly the same.
