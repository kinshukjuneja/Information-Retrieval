The regime was harsh and <a href="/wiki/Corporal_punishment" title="Corporal punishment">corporal punishment</a> was often employed.

An NSPCC inspector described the conditions in which the Menheniotts lived as "deplorable". On 29 January 1959, the 19-month-old Stephen was taken into care direct from hospital by <a href="/wiki/East_Sussex_County_Council" title="East Sussex County Council">East Sussex County Council</a> and placed in a residential nursery.

However, in January 1961 his foster mother became pregnant with her first child, and Stephen\'s behaviour became highly disturbed. On 18 December 1961 he was readmitted to the residential nursery and it was decided that, due to his behaviour and his now obvious learning difficulties ("retardation" as it was then described), all contact with his foster parents should be severed. In February 1964 he was transferred to a children\'s home. From January 1962, he often visited and was visited by two local ladies who had offered to "befriend" a child as "aunties", and they became very fond of each other. In 1964, Stephen began attending a special school, but it was determined that he was too intelligent for this school (his <a href="/wiki/IQ" class="mw-redirect" title="IQ">IQ</a> was assessed at 89), and in January 1966 he was transferred to the remedial class of the local primary school. He remained at this school and living in the children\'s home until July 1968, when he was eleven. In 1966, he began to visit his older brother, who was living with a foster family in Kent, but these visits were difficult as the brother (in common with many other people) found him somewhat irritating.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Isles_of_Scilly">The Isles of Scilly</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Menheniott&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: The Isles of Scilly">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In 1962, Tom and Elizabeth Menheniott moved to a tied <a href="/wiki/Cottage" title="Cottage">cottage</a> (i.e. a cottage that comes with a job) in East Sussex and their youngest daughter was returned to them from the foster home in <a href="/wiki/Hastings" title="Hastings">Hastings</a> where she had spent the last eighteen months.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> In 1965, the family moved to the Isles of Scilly.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Isles of Scilly are very isolated and had a population at that time of about 2,400.

The hamlet consisted of only three cottages, one of which was empty and one let to holidaymakers in season, and a farm. Tom was not particularly popular on the island, but he became something of a local \'character\' and was seen as useful because of his mechanical skills (which he sometimes practised without charge). An unkempt, powerfully built man, he was known for his temper and bad language, but was also capable of acts of kindness. He was good at his job, got on well with his employer, and had apparently stopped drinking (he had previously been known as a heavy drinker).<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id="Return_to_family.2C_1968.E2.80.931969"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Return_to_family,_1968\xe2\x80\x931969">Return to family, 1968\xe2\x80\x931969</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Menheniott&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Return to family, 1968\xe2\x80\x931969">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Tom Menheniott had been asking for news of his children since 1966 and Stephen appeared to want to see his father (although he rarely mentioned his mother); and in 1967 the children\'s officer for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly wrote to East Sussex County Council suggesting that, as the family now seemed to be settled, a visit could be arranged. On 15 August 1967, Stephen and his <a href="/wiki/Social_worker" class="mw-redirect" title="Social worker">social worker</a> set off for the Isles of Scilly, where the social worker reported that Tom was "brusque", "belligerent" and "intimidating". Stephen stayed with his family for twelve days, then returned to East Sussex. He began to regularly correspond with them and visited again at Christmas 1967 and Easter 1968. The two children in the care of Cornwall and the brother in care in Kent (who had run away from his foster parents in February 1968 and made his own way to the Isles of Scilly) were now living with their parents under "home on trial" arrangements. No signs of ill-treatment were seen, and after he had stayed with his family over the 1968 summer holidays, Stephen was allowed to stay permanently.

The 15-year-old brother was found to have a fractured <a href="/wiki/Humerus" title="Humerus">humerus</a> and said that he had no wish to return to his family; he was returned to his foster home in Kent.<sup id="cite_ref-DHSS_Report,_pp.14\xe2\x80\x9315_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DHSS_Report,_pp.14\xe2\x80\x9315-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Several of the children later admitted that they had had arms broken by Tom at one time or another, but were too frightened to report it at the time. Tom\'s relations with the other islanders deteriorated, as most of them seem to have believed that he was wrongly acquitted.<sup id="cite_ref-DHSS_Report,_p.22_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DHSS_Report,_p.22-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Cornwall County Council proposed placing Stephen in a residential special school, but the <a href="/wiki/Educational_psychologist" title="Educational psychologist">educational psychologist</a> who assessed him considered that this would be inappropriate as, although he was currently functioning at below average ability, he was of near average intelligence. Stephen himself expressed a desire to return to East Sussex and on 22 December 1969 his wishes were granted.<sup id="cite_ref-DHSS_Report,_pp.14\xe2\x80\x9315_14-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DHSS_Report,_pp.14\xe2\x80\x9315-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, Stephen then expressed a desire to return to his family. He was living in an assessment centre and was isolated, finding it difficult to make friends and being bullied, although he was popular with adults. He was likeable and polite, although he had occasional aggressive outbursts, usually directed at inanimate objects. For some reason, his two "aunties" were not informed of his return to the county. He was transferred to the centre\'s long stay unit, but did not attend school. He continued to correspond regularly with his family and began to ask to visit. His mother, however, was now living on the mainland (and was never to return to Tom<sup id="cite_ref-DHSS_Report,_p.22_12-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DHSS_Report,_p.22-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>) and only the oldest sister had returned to live with her father. She and Tom expressed a desire for Stephen\'s return. The children\'s officer for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly disagreed, describing Tom as "an aggressive psychopath and a morally corrupt man". However, social workers in East Sussex decided that Stephen needed his family and he was allowed to visit between 24 December 1971 and 5 January 1972.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>On 7 August 1972 he once again travelled to the Isles of Scilly, supposedly for a three-week visit. It was, however, obvious at this stage that he would not be expected to return to East Sussex. When the children\'s officer in Cornwall heard about this, she wrote to the director of social services of East Sussex expressing her deep disapproval and stating that it would be impossible for Cornwall Social Services to arrange any supervision due to the isolation of the location and the aggressive attitude of Tom Menheniott. East Sussex Social Services replied that they did not share her concern. Stephen was allowed to stay with his father and nobody from East Sussex Social Services ever visited him, despite the fact that East Sussex County Council had assumed parental rights until his eighteenth birthday. East Sussex closed their case file on Stephen.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> The family now consisted of Tom, his 20-year-old oldest daughter, her oldest child (she had two more children in the next two years), and the 17-year-old Stephen.<sup id="cite_ref-DHSS_Report,_p.22_12-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DHSS_Report,_p.22-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id="Last_years_in_the_Isles_of_Scilly.2C_1972.E2.80.931976"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Last_years_in_the_Isles_of_Scilly,_1972\xe2\x80\x931976">Last years in the Isles of Scilly, 1972\xe2\x80\x931976</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Menheniott&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Last years in the Isles of Scilly, 1972\xe2\x80\x931976">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Stephen obtained employment as a shelf-stacker in a local supermarket, but was dismissed after about six months due to his poor personal hygiene. Shortly before this, the Council of the Isles reported to the children\'s officer that there seemed to be no problems. However, in April 1973 the youngest daughter and her boyfriend visited Holy Vale and Tom beat her up. Stephen was given employment by a flower farmer, but was reluctantly dismissed after it became obvious that he would never be able to work on his own. He may have later worked casually on the same farm as his father. Few people visited the increasingly squalid cottage and, apart from Tom, the Menheniotts were rarely seen around the island. When the community nurse visited to check up on the young children, she described Stephen as "looking like a frightened rabbit", but did not see any signs of physical injury.<sup id="cite_ref-DHSS_Report,_p.23_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DHSS_Report,_p.23-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> However, in October 1975 Stephen visited the island\'s dentist, a Mr Fairest, where it was found that three of his front teeth were broken beyond repair.<sup id="cite_ref-trial_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-trial-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 1976, Stephen disappeared.

He had five fractures on four ribs, one of which was fractured twice within days of his death.
