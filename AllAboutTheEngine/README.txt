i. What was the most difficult part of this assignment? 

-> This assignment was more theoretical and unusual from rest of the assignments done so far. It was surprisingly more time consuming for me to complete this assignment compared to all the previous ones. To come up with some relevant research and also make some educated guesses was difficult at times.

ii. What was the easiest part?

-> The easiest part was that there was no Math or Regex involved. It was also pretty much open-ended which was good in coming up with a lot of material on search queries and ranking of results.

iii. What did you learn about the engine you analyzed that most surprised you?

-> Netflix works on a dedicated domain of movies, tv shows and documentaries. I was therefore, not expecting it to do so well with long complex queries and some of the informative queries. To my surprise, it passed in processing most of these queries along with all the other weird queries I was trying to break it. 
It handled all the misspelled, missing prefix and suffix queries really well and it sort of gave me a hint that it is using Soundex algorithm in coming up with results.
It also handled all the gibberish queries by displaying anime movies in particular, which gave me a hint that it processes such queries assuming they have been written by a child. I was most surprised by this level of detail in their backend processing to handle all the edge cases.
